        </div>
        <p>
            I recently wrote my first cryptocurrency trading bot. I started by playing
            with historical prices for Bitcoin at ten minute intervals — I loaded them
            into Python Pandas dataframes and ran some si-mulations, buying low and
            selling high. It looked great! The code was simple, too — I figured it
            wouldn’t take more than a few hours to bolt on some robin_stock functions
            and go to town. I was wrong. Here’s what I learned as I went — perhaps it
            will save you some time.
        </p>

        <h2 class="subtitle">Trading in simulation is simpler than trading in real life</h2>

        <p>
            When you simulate trades, you are probably making some assumptions. Your
            program decides to buy or sell at the price at that moment in time, and it
            succeeds, every time. Your simulation racks up the profit!
            <br></br>
            Reality isn’t
            quite as easy. Actual trades take a little time, and the price is
            changing. When your bot is trading live, sometimes only part of your order
            will complete before the price shifts significantly. It may not even
            complete any of the order. I refer to this as a “swing and miss”. Your bot
            needs to handle these situations gracefully. I opted to save the order
            transaction number and check the re-sults every so often — if, after a
            hour, it didn’t result in a buy of coin, the bot cancelled the buy order
            and tried again.
        </p>

        <div class="quote-container">
            <p class="quote">In simulation, all your orders complete — in real life, you need to check for partial
                completion or
                missing the order entirely.</p>
        </div>

        <h2 class="subtitle">Limit buys and sells are your friend</h2>
        <p>When you trade live, you need to issue your buys and sells as either a limit order or market order. With a
            market order, the transaction will be completed at whatever the going rate is. That’s bad. Be careful with
            that, because that price can MOVE in a matter of seconds. That’s why you have a bot in the first place! I
            chose to place my orders as limit transactions, so that if the price moved dra-matically, it wouldn’t buy or
            sell at a different price than I had intended.</p>
